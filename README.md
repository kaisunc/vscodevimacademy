# ABOUT

An educational game to learn vim and vscode keys in logical, digestable levels.
Builds up your vim muscle memories by practicing vim keys 2~5 keys each level. Level text and keys are randomly generated on a per level basis. For example,

1. move forward or backward by word
2. go up or down a random number of lines
3. delete word forward or backwards from current position
4. delete word, undo or redo
5. select, delete, or change lines
6. delete, copy, or paste words
7. and more

players complete 10 sets of the tasks as quickly with as little key presses as possible. Hints and manual will be listed on the right panel(CONSOLE), your performance will be logged per task based on how fast your performed and how many keypresses you used.

# Authors Note
2022/6/2
If you didn't receive your license key an hour after using paypal, please email me directly at vscodevimacademy@gmail.com. I'll find your paypal IPN number and generate a license manually. (My license generating server that listens for paypal messages does not work for Paypal users in China)

I intended to add some nifty animations that points from the cursor to the location along with the helpers introduced in this update. But feel that it is too distracting. In the end, a little burnt out, but I'll be doing small updates if possible. Thanks for the people that bought this!

# THANKS
For the four initial buyers and supporters of VVA, gave me some faith that this just might work.

If you find this extension useful, spread the word, give me some feedback at the git repo or extension marketplace and perhaps buy the extension.
With enough support, I would like to rework the task decorationOptions to use svg animations instead of the vscode default fadeIn fadeOut css animation. Something cool, like arrows pointing to navigating positions or text delete animations using SVG.


# NOTES
Buy a license to unlock all the levels

Seller page is ./ , copy images from SOURCE markdown dir, NEED this for image hosting for public repo
vvaServer GIT repo is for generating licenses from paypal ipa
Vscode Marketplace page is updated when published, uses README from SOURCE REPO -->

# TODO
1. demonstrate the learning process of vva
1. demonstrate what a high level vim user is capable of
1. my keybindings for other parts of vscode that uses the same keys as vim. (side panels, terminal, command palette)
1. level descriptions
1. webpack the extension
